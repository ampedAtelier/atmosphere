## Libraries
The libraries used the Arduino sketch are:
* [Arcada Libraries](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-pybadge/arcada-libraries) — general hardware abstraction for EdgeBadge and similar boards.
* [Adafruit GFX Graphics Library](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library/overview) — used to draw the screen display
* [Adafruit PM25 AQI](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_PM25AQI) — Arduino library for PMS* Air Quality Sensors 

## Fringe Festival Entry
Atmosphere is a multidisciplinary work combining wearable technology, fashion and poetry to create a stunning site-sensitive work that critiques how consumerism feeds air pollution. With air pollutant sensors embedded in the outfit, the dress will change colours according to the [PSI scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollutant_Standards_Index) in real time. The performer then recites a verse that corresponds to the colour, narrating the troubling fictional futures humanity may face with increasing air pollution. Following the performer along a designated route along [Orchard Roads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchard_Road) allows audiences to feel the full immersive experience and is a commentary of how consumerism represented by fashion could lead us to a future where we won’t be able to even see the clothes on our backs.
